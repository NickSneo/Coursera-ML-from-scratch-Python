# Coursera Machine Learning Course from Scratch in Python
---
This repository contains the assignments of Coursera ML Course implemented in Python from scratch.
Assignments are coded using numpy and everything is vectorized.

## Libraries
---
This is a list of libraries I used during assignments
* numpy
* matplotlib
* pandas (when the dataset is given in csv)
* scipy (only for loading the dataset from .mat files and using imread and imsave for kmeans assignment)
* scikit-learn (**Only in SVM**)

## Resources
